## FAQ  
Q: Is this compatible with other mods?   
A: I can't make any guarantees. It's been tested with Widescreen Fix, Extra Options, Unlimiter, and HUD Resizer. All texture mods and car mods should work.  

Q: What are the system requirements?  
A: It's difficult to say because it depends on your resolution, settings, and other enhancements being used. For 1080p, an NVIDIA GTX 1060 / AMD RX 480 should be more than enough for default settings.
