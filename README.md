## FAQ  
Q: **Is this compatible with other mods?**  
A: I can't make any promises. It's been tested with Widescreen Fix, Xbox 360 Stuff, XtendedInput, Extra Options, and Unlimiter. All texture mods and car mods should work.  

Q: **What are the system requirements?**  
A: It depends on your resolution, settings, and other graphical enhancements being used. For 1080p, an NVIDIA GTX 1060 / AMD RX 480 should be more than enough for the default configuration.  

Q: **Why is a No-CD fix required?**  
A: Need for Speed games have protections (DRM) that make it difficult to view and modify their code, so No-CD patches are often recommended when using ASI mods. Additionally, the memory addresses in my mods are all hardcoded and it's not something I can easily change.  

Q: **Why is the Widescreen Fix recommended?**  
A: Most features I make are often designed to work with the Widescreen Fix. Carbon's "ReflectionContrast" (HD Reflections) and "LightingFix" (Widescreen Fix) features are a good example of this. The Widescreen Fix also provides a solid foundation that everyone should use, since it corrects visual and technical errors the PC ports have.
