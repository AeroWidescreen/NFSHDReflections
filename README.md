## FAQ  
Q: Is this compatible with other mods?  
A: I can't make any guarantees. It's been tested with Widescreen Fix, Extra Options, Unlimiter, and HUD Resizer. All texture mods and car mods should work.  

Q: What are the system requirements?  
A: It's difficult to say because it depends on your resolution, settings, and other enhancements being used. For 1080p, an NVIDIA GTX 1060 / AMD RX 480 should be more than enough for default settings.  

Q: Why is a No-CD fix required?  
A: Need for Speed games have protections (DRM) that make it difficult to view and modify their code, so No-CD patches are often recommended when using ASI scripts. In addition, the memory addresses in my scripts are all harcoded, so it's not something I can easily change. If you're concerned about security, ask the community on the NFSMods Discord to help you acquire these patches from a trusted source.  

Q: Why is the latest version of the Widescreen Fix recommended?  
A: Most of the features I make are often designed to work with the Widescreen Fix, as I'm heavily involved in the development of both mods. Carbon's "XB360Reflections" and "LightingFix" features are a good example of this. The Widescreen Fix is also a good foundation that everyone should use, since it corrects visual and technical errors the PC ports have.  

Q: Why don't I have water reflections like your screenshot of Need for Speed Most Wanted?  
A: Install Xbox 360 Stuff Pack V2 by osdever & elaymm4. My screenshot simply demonstrates the improvement in resolution.  

Q: What happened to the old mod pages?  
A: They've been deleted. I've decided to consolidate everything into a single package; this applies to the download page and source code. It's easier to manage and more convenient for everyone.
