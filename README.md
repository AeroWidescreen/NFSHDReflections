## FAQ  
Q: **Is this compatible with other mods?**  
A: I can't make any promises. It's been tested with Widescreen Fix, XtendedInput, Extra Options, and Unlimiter. All texture mods and car mods should work.  

Q: **What are the system requirements?**  
A: It depends on your resolution, settings, and other graphical enhancements being used. For 1080p, an NVIDIA GTX 1060 / AMD RX 480 should be more than enough for the default configuration.  

Q: **Why is a No-CD fix required?**  
A: Need for Speed games have protections (DRM) that make it difficult to view and modify their code, so No-CD patches are often recommended when using ASI scripts. Additionally, the memory addresses in my scripts are all hardcoded and it's not something I can easily change.     

Q: **Why don't I have water reflections like your screenshot of Need for Speed Most Wanted?**  
A: Install Xbox 360 Stuff Pack. My screenshot simply demonstrates the improvement in resolution and detail.
