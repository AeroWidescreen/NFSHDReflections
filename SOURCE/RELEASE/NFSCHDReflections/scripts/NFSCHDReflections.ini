OldGPUCompatibility = 0              // Vehicle reflections will be rounded to the nearest power of two.
VehicleScale = 1.0                   // Controls the resolution multiplier of vehicle reflections.
RoadScale = 1.0                      // Controls the resolution multiplier of road reflections.
MirrorScale = 1.0                    // Controls the resolution multiplier of the rearview mirror.
PIPScale = 1.0                       // Controls the resolution multiplier of picture-in-picture.
CubemapRes = 256                     // Controls the resolution of vehicle cubemaps used in the front-end. New textures are required. (256 = Min | 2048 = Max)

[GENERAL]

RestoreDetails = 1                   // Adds car models to road reflections.
ReflectionContrast = 1               // Adjusts world brightness and light visibility for vehicle reflectons. (1 = Xbox 360 | 2 = PS3)
AlignmentFix = 1                     // Corrects the alignment of vehicle reflections.
ForceEnvironmentMap = 0              // Forces a single environment map to be used for all locations. (1 - 5) https://i.imgur.com/c8NfBBW.png
AspectRatioFix = 1                   // Corrects the proportions of vehicle reflections.

RestoreSkybox = 1                    // Adds the skybox to reflections.
EnableMirror = 1                     // Enables the mirror when a new profile is created or when default settings are used.
RealFrontEndReflections = 0          // Enables real-time vehicle reflections in the front-end.
ReflectionBlurStrength = 1.0         // Controls the amount of blur used for road reflections and increases its resolution. Use -1 to disable.
VehicleReflectionBrightness = 1.0    // Controls the intensity of vehicle reflections.

[EXTRA]
ReplaceVisualTreatmentIG = 0         // Changes the LUT that's used while in-game. (0 = FILTER0 | 1 = FILTER1 | 2 = FILTER2 | 3 = FILTER3)

PauseBlur = 1                        // Blurs the background whenever the game is paused.
RealisticChrome = 1                  // Makes the chrome materiel more reflective. Requires "high" shader detail in video settings.
